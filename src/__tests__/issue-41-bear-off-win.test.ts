/**
 * Regression for issue nodots/backgammon-ai#41
 *
 * In production game bf09273a-0f04-459a-bc9a-79dd94dcc80c the GNU Intermediate
 * robot threw away an immediate, trivial win on the final turn. Black had two
 * checkers in its home board (cw23/ccw2 and cw24/ccw1), 13 already off, and
 * rolled (1,4). The unique winning play is to bear off both. The robot
 * instead played die-1 as 2->1 (point-to-point) then die-4 as 1->off, leaving
 * one checker on the board.
 *
 * Root cause (verified locally with the real native addon): GNU returns two
 * hints with essentially-tied equity (~1.0 + float noise):
 *
 *   #0  equity=1.0000005   2->1 (point-to-point)  1->0 (bear-off)   <- slow
 *   #1  equity=0.9999995   1->0 (bear-off)        2->0 (bear-off)   <- wins
 *
 * The robot was blindly taking hints[0]. The fix in robotExecution.ts adds an
 * equity-tied tiebreaker that prefers the line with more bear-offs, which
 * matches the racing principle "off > pips" without overriding GNU's actual
 * judgment in non-tied positions.
 *
 * This test mocks the engine with the exact two-hint payload observed for
 * the production position and asserts that the AI executes the immediate-win
 * sequence.
